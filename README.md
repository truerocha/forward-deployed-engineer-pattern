## What Is This?

This repo is a **factory template** for enterprise-grade AI-assisted software development using [Amazon Kiro](https://kiro.dev). It implements the Autonomous Code Factory pattern (Level 4 autonomy) where AI agents handle the full development loop — writing, testing, reviewing, and packaging code — while the human engineer operates as **Factory Operator**, writing specs and approving outcomes.

The pattern is built on **Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs)** — AI agents deployed into a project's specific context: its pipeline architecture, its knowledge artifacts, its quality standards, and its governance boundaries. An FDE is not a general-purpose coding assistant. It is an engineering partner that knows your system.

## The Operating Model

```
Staff Engineer writes spec → Agent generates tests → Human approves tests
  → Agent implements (makes tests green) → Adversarial gate challenges each write
    → CI/CD validates → Ship-readiness (Docker + E2E + holdout scenarios)
      → Agent opens MR → Human approves outcome → Code ships
```

The Staff Engineer:
- **Writes specs** (the control plane — what should exist)
- **Approves test contracts** (the halting condition — when is it done)
- **Approves outcomes** (the MR — does it serve the user)
- **Never writes implementation code**
- **Never reviews diffs line-by-line** (automated gates handle correctness)

## Empirical Results

Same task, same AI agent. Without FDE protocol: **33%** quality score. With FDE protocol: **100%** quality score.

```
FDE wins: 12 criteria  |  Bare wins: 0  |  Ties: 6
Improvement: +67 percentage points
```

## Architecture

![Autonomous Code Factory Architecture](docs/architecture/autonomous-code-factory.png)

> Spine: Staff Engineer → ALM → Spec → Agent Execution → CI/CD → Ship-Readiness → Delivery → Staff Engineer approves outcome.
> Branches: Cross-session learning (notes) and meta-agent (prompt refinement).

Each workspace is a **production line** for a specific codebase. The Staff Engineer manages multiple lines simultaneously, routing work and approving outcomes.

    +-- WORKSPACE A ---- Spec in -> Ship-ready MR out
    +-- WORKSPACE B ---- Spec in -> Ship-ready MR out
    +-- WORKSPACE C ---- Spec in -> Ship-ready MR out
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Global setup (one-time)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/truerocha/forward-deployed-engineer-pattern.git ~/factory-template
cd ~/factory-template
bash scripts/provision-workspace.sh --global
```

### 2. Onboard a project

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-project
bash ~/factory-template/scripts/provision-workspace.sh --project
# Then customize .kiro/steering/fde.md for YOUR project
```

### 3. Activate in Kiro

```
#fde Execute the spec in .kiro/specs/my-feature.md
```

See [docs/guides/fde-adoption-guide.md](docs/guides/fde-adoption-guide.md) for the full walkthrough with Next.js and Python microservice examples.

## Research Foundations

The pattern draws from six peer-reviewed studies:

1. **Esposito et al. (2025)** — 93% of GenAI architecture studies lack formal validation
2. **Vandeputte et al. (2025)** — Verification at all levels, not only unit tests
3. **Shonan Meeting 222 (2025)** — Greenfield does not generalize to brownfield
4. **DiCuffa et al. (2025)** — "Context and Instruction" is the most efficient prompt pattern (p<10 to the negative 32)
5. **Bhandwaldar et al. (2026)** — Agent scaling yields 8.27x mean speedup with 10 agents
6. **Wong et al. (2026)** — Agent scaffolding matters as much as model capability (CCA: 59% on SWE-Bench-Pro)

## Running the Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
python3 scripts/lint_language.py docs/design/forward-deployed-ai-engineers.md
```

## CI/CD Integration

The factory integrates with GitHub Actions and GitLab CI Ultimate (through mirror). Agents work on feature branches. They never merge, deploy, or modify CI config.
