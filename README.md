## What Is This?

This repo is a **factory template** for enterprise-grade AI-assisted software development using [Amazon Kiro](https://kiro.dev). It implements the Autonomous Code Factory pattern (Level 4 autonomy) where AI agents handle the full development loop — writing, testing, reviewing, and packaging code — while the human engineer operates as **Factory Operator**, writing specs and approving outcomes.

The pattern is built on **Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs)** — AI agents deployed into a project's specific context: its pipeline architecture, its knowledge artifacts, its quality standards, and its governance boundaries. An FDE is not a general-purpose coding assistant. It is an engineering partner that knows your system.

## The Operating Model

```
Staff Engineer writes spec → Agent generates tests → Human approves tests
  → Agent implements (makes tests green) → Adversarial gate challenges each write
    → CI/CD validates → Ship-readiness (Docker + E2E + holdout scenarios)
      → Agent opens MR → Human approves outcome → Code ships
```

The Staff Engineer:
- **Writes specs** (the control plane — what should exist)
- **Approves test contracts** (the halting condition — when is it done)
- **Approves outcomes** (the MR — does it serve the user)
- **Never writes implementation code**
- **Never reviews diffs line-by-line** (automated gates handle correctness)

## Empirical Results

Same task, same AI agent. Without FDE protocol: **33%** quality score. With FDE protocol: **100%** quality score.

```
FDE wins: 12 criteria  |  Bare wins: 0  |  Ties: 6
Improvement: +67 percentage points
```

## Architecture

![Autonomous Code Factory — Hero Overview](docs/architecture/planes/00-hero-overview.png)

The factory is organized into **5 modular planes**, each with its own diagram and design narrative:

| # | Plane | Responsibility | Diagram |
|---|-------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | [Version Source Management](docs/architecture/planes/01-vsm-plane.md) | Git, ALM platforms, project isolation, PR delivery | ![VSM](docs/architecture/planes/01-vsm-plane.png) |
| 2 | [FDE (Forward Deployed Engineer)](docs/architecture/planes/02-fde-plane.md) | Autonomy resolution, agent builder, pipeline execution | ![FDE](docs/architecture/planes/02-fde-plane.png) |
| 3 | [Context](docs/architecture/planes/03-context-plane.md) | Constraint extraction, prompt registry, scope boundaries, learning | ![Context](docs/architecture/planes/03-context-plane.png) |
| 4 | [Data](docs/architecture/planes/04-data-plane.md) | Router, task queue, artifact storage, EventBridge | ![Data](docs/architecture/planes/04-data-plane.png) |
| 5 | [Control](docs/architecture/planes/05-control-plane.md) | SDLC gates, DORA metrics, pipeline safety, failure modes | ![Control](docs/architecture/planes/05-control-plane.png) |

### AWS Reference Architecture

![Reference Architecture](docs/architecture/reference-architecture.png)

The complete AWS reference architecture shows all cloud services, data flows, and integration points in a single view. It covers: API Gateway (webhook ingestion), EventBridge (event routing), ECS Fargate (headless agent execution), Amazon Bedrock (LLM inference), DynamoDB (state management), S3 (artifact storage), Lambda (DAG fan-out + dead-letter), CloudWatch/SNS/SQS (observability), CloudFront (dashboard CDN), and Secrets Manager (credential isolation).

> Generate: `python3 scripts/generate_reference_architecture.py`

**Cloud orchestration (optional):** When deployed to AWS, ALM webhooks flow through API Gateway → EventBridge → ECS Fargate, where a Strands agent container runs the FDE protocol headless using Bedrock for inference. Results are written to S3 and ALM status is updated automatically. See [Cloud Orchestration Flow](docs/flows/13-cloud-orchestration.md).

Each workspace is a **production line** for a specific codebase. The Staff Engineer manages multiple lines simultaneously, routing work and approving outcomes.

```
~/.kiro/ (GLOBAL — universal laws, shared credentials, cross-project knowledge)
    |
    +-- WORKSPACE A ---- Spec in -> Ship-ready MR out
    +-- WORKSPACE B ---- Spec in -> Ship-ready MR out
    +-- WORKSPACE C ---- Spec in -> Ship-ready MR out
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Pre-flight validation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/truerocha/forward-deployed-engineer-pattern.git ~/factory-template
cd ~/factory-template
bash scripts/pre-flight-fde.sh
```

The pre-flight script validates your machine (tools, runtimes, credentials) and collects project configuration interactively. It writes a manifest to `~/.kiro/fde-manifest.json`.

### 2. Validate deployment resources

```bash
bash scripts/validate-deploy-fde.sh
```

Validates three planes:
- **Control Plane**: Kiro steerings, hooks, specs structure
- **Data Plane**: ALM platforms (GitHub Projects / Asana / GitLab Ultimate) API access
- **FDE Plane**: MCP servers, factory template integrity, global laws

### 3. Deploy the Code Factory

```bash
bash scripts/code-factory-setup.sh
```

For each project in your manifest:
- **Greenfield**: initializes repo, creates `requirements.md` template for agents to read
- **Brownfield**: clones repo, scans conventions (languages, test frameworks, linters, CI/CD) so agents match existing patterns
- Provisions workspace with hooks, steerings, MCP config, and task templates
- Enables hooks automatically based on engineering level (L2/L3/L4)
- Writes factory state dashboard to `~/.kiro/factory-state.md`

### 4. Start working

```bash
# Open your project in Kiro IDE
# Move items to "In Progress" on your board (GitHub Projects / Asana / GitLab)
# Trigger the work intake hook, or:
#fde Execute the spec in .kiro/specs/my-feature.md
```

See [docs/guides/fde-adoption-guide.md](docs/guides/fde-adoption-guide.md) for the full walkthrough with Next.js and Python microservice examples.

## Research Foundations

The pattern draws from six peer-reviewed studies:

1. **Esposito et al. (2025)** — 93% of GenAI architecture studies lack formal validation
2. **Vandeputte et al. (2025)** — Verification at all levels, not only unit tests
3. **Shonan Meeting 222 (2025)** — Greenfield does not generalize to brownfield
4. **DiCuffa et al. (2025)** — "Context and Instruction" is the most efficient prompt pattern (p<10 to the negative 32)
5. **Bhandwaldar et al. (2026)** — Agent scaling yields 8.27x mean speedup with 10 agents
6. **Wong et al. (2026)** — Agent scaffolding matters as much as model capability (CCA: 59% on SWE-Bench-Pro)

## Running the Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
python3 scripts/lint_language.py docs/design/forward-deployed-ai-engineers.md
```

## CI/CD Integration

The factory integrates with GitHub Actions and GitLab CI Ultimate (through mirror). Agents work on feature branches. They never merge, deploy, or modify CI config.
