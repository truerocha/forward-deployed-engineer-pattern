# Autonomous Code Factory

> You write the spec. The factory ships the code.

An enterprise-grade pattern for AI-driven software development where **AI agents handle the full engineering loop** — planning, coding, testing, reviewing, and delivering — while the human engineer operates as the architect and approver.

## The Problem

AI coding assistants today are reactive: you prompt, they generate, you review line-by-line, you fix, you prompt again. This doesn't scale beyond one project. It produces locally correct changes that cascade into system-level issues. The human remains the bottleneck.

## The Solution

The Autonomous Code Factory inverts the model. The human defines **what** (specs, acceptance criteria). The factory handles **how** (implementation, testing, delivery). Quality is enforced by automated gates, not manual review.

```
Spec → Tests (human approves) → Implementation → Adversarial Review → CI/CD → PR → Ship
```

**The Staff Engineer:**
- Writes specs (what should exist)
- Approves test contracts (when is it done)
- Approves outcomes (does it serve the user)
- Never writes implementation code
- Never reviews diffs line-by-line

---

## Results

Same task, same AI model. Without the factory protocol: **33%** quality. With it: **100%**.

```
Factory wins: 12 criteria  |  Bare AI wins: 0  |  Ties: 6
Improvement: +67 percentage points
```

## How It Works

### 1. Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs)

Not general-purpose assistants. AI agents deployed into **your project's specific context** — its architecture, its test patterns, its quality standards, its governance rules. An FDE knows your system before it writes a line of code.

### 2. Predictive Risk Scoring

Before any agent executes, a **Bayesian Risk Engine** calculates `P(Failure|Context)` using 18 signals (code complexity, DORA metrics, failure history, design quality, reasoning divergence, coordination overhead). High-risk tasks are blocked or escalated automatically. The engine self-improves via gradient descent on outcomes.

### 3. SWE Synapses — Design Intelligence

Five cognitive design principles (grounded in peer-reviewed research) fire before the Conductor generates a plan. They determine whether to plan or explore (Ralph 2013), whether decomposition is cost-justified (Homay 2025), whether agent responsibilities are deep enough (Ousterhout), whether the architectural bundle is coherent (Wei 2026), and what the system actually knows about the domain (King & Kimble 2004). Two additional synapses (6: Transparency, 7: Deterministic Harness) provide runtime governance. The result: prescriptive guidance instead of reactive gating.

### 4. AI-DLC Alignment & Multi-Platform Support

The factory implements the [AI-DLC methodology](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows) and exports its rules to **6 platforms** (Kiro, Q Developer, Cursor, Cline, Claude Code, Copilot). An **Extension Opt-In System** (`fde-profile.json`) lets teams tune FDE intensity per project — from minimal (DoR + DoD only) to strict (all gates + all extensions). Optional **Brown-Field Elevation** and **DDD Design Phase** inject domain modeling steps before code generation for complex tasks.

### 4. Dynamic Agent Squads

A **Conductor** (inspired by Nielsen et al., ICLR 2026) composes specialized agent teams per task — security reviewers, architects, developers, adversarial testers — matched to complexity. Simple bugfixes get 3 agents. Complex features get 8.

### 5. Distributed Execution

Each agent runs as an independent ECS task with its own resources, logs, and retry policy. Parallel stages. Agent-level failure isolation. Instant rollback between monolith and distributed modes.

### 6. Automated Quality Gates

18 hooks enforce quality at every step: test immutability, adversarial challenges, circuit breakers, pipeline validation, ship-readiness checks. No code ships without passing the full gate chain.

## Architecture

![Autonomous Code Factory](docs/architecture/reference-architecture.png)

Five modular planes:

| Plane | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Version Source Management** | Git, ALM platforms, project isolation, PR delivery |
| **FDE (Agent)** | Autonomy resolution, agent composition, pipeline execution |
| **Context** | Constraint extraction, prompt registry, scope boundaries |
| **Data** | Event routing, task queue, artifact storage |
| **Control** | SDLC gates, DORA metrics, risk scoring, failure classification |

> [Full reference architecture](docs/architecture/reference-architecture.png) — all AWS services, data flows, and integration points.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and validate your environment
git clone https://github.com/truerocha/forward-deployed-engineer-pattern.git
cd forward-deployed-engineer-pattern
bash scripts/pre-flight-fde.sh

# 2. Validate ALM connectivity (GitHub / GitLab / Asana)
bash scripts/validate-deploy-fde.sh

# 3. Deploy the factory to your project
bash scripts/code-factory-setup.sh

# 4. Start working
# Move items to "In Progress" on your board, or:
#fde Execute the spec in .kiro/specs/my-feature.md
```

See the [Adoption Guide](docs/guides/fde-adoption-guide.md) for a full walkthrough.

---

## Cloud Deployment (Optional)

When deployed to AWS, the factory runs headless:

```
ALM Webhook → API Gateway → EventBridge → ECS Fargate (Strands Agent + Bedrock) → PR
```

Infrastructure is defined in `infra/terraform/` — ECR, ECS Fargate, Bedrock, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, CloudFront, Secrets Manager. Deploy with `terraform apply`.

## Research Foundations

Built on six peer-reviewed studies:

1. **Esposito et al. (2025)** — 93% of GenAI architecture studies lack formal validation
2. **Vandeputte et al. (2025)** — Verification at all levels, not only unit tests
3. **Shonan Meeting 222 (2025)** — Greenfield does not generalize to brownfield
4. **DiCuffa et al. (2025)** — "Context and Instruction" is the most efficient prompt pattern
5. **Bhandwaldar et al. (2026)** — Agent scaling yields 8.27x mean speedup with 10 agents
6. **Nielsen et al. (2026)** — RL Conductor outperforms all manually-designed multi-agent pipelines
