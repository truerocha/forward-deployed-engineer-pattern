# Design Document: Autonomous Code Factory

> Forward Deployed Engineer — GenAI powered by Kiro
> Version: 3.1
> Date: 2026-05-07

## Executive Summary

This document describes the design of the Autonomous Code Factory, a system that enables a Staff Engineer to manage multiple software projects simultaneously by delegating implementation to AI agents governed by structured specifications, quality gates, and automated validation.

## Problem Statement

Standard AI-assisted development follows a reactive cycle: the human writes prompts, reviews generated code line-by-line, and manually coordinates between the IDE, ALM systems, CI/CD pipelines, and documentation. This approach does not scale beyond one project and produces locally correct changes that cascade into system-level issues.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

| 1.3 | Staff Engineer | Trigger ship-readiness validation (Docker, E2E, holdout) | P0 |
| 1.4 | Staff Engineer | Trigger release (semantic commit, MR, ALM update) | P0 |
| 2.1 | Agent | Execute specs following the 4-phase protocol (Recon, Intake, Engineering, Completion) | P0 |
| 2.2 | Agent | Generate tests from spec scenarios before writing production code | P0 |

## Open Questions

1. How to handle inter-workspace dependency validation at scale (currently manual via interface contracts)
2. ~~When to introduce Strands SDK for parallel agent orchestration~~ — **Resolved**: Strands SDK deployed in `infra/docker/agents/` (2026-05-05). Agent registry, builder, and orchestrator use Strands Agent instances.
3. How to measure ROI of the factory compared to traditional development
4. When to promote `fde-doc-gardening` from `userTriggered` to `postTaskExecution` (COE-012 recurrence suggests now)
5. ~~When to add predictive risk scoring before agent execution~~ — **Resolved**: Risk Inference Engine deployed at `src/core/risk/` (2026-05-12). Bayesian P(Failure|Context) with 13 signals, sigmoid activation, SHAP-like explanations, and self-improving weights via gradient descent. See ADR-022.
