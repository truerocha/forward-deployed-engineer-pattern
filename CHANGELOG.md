## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-12

### Added — SWE Synapses Cognitive Architecture (ADR-024)
- `src/core/synapses/__init__.py` — New package implementing five cognitive design principles extracted from peer-reviewed software engineering theory. Each synapse is grounded in academic research, measurable via the Risk Engine, actionable by the Conductor, and observable via the Fidelity Score.
- `src/core/synapses/paradigm_selector.py` — Synapse 3 (Ralph 2013): Selects rational, alternative, or hybrid design paradigm based on organism level, prior success rate, requirement stability, and domain novelty. Generates conductor guidance for topology selection.
- `src/core/synapses/decomposition_cost.py` — Synapse 4 (Homay 2025): Evaluates whether task decomposition is cost-justified using the Fundamental Theorem of Software Engineering. Detects over-decomposition and recommends consolidation when agents share excessive state.
- `src/core/synapses/interface_depth.py` — Synapse 1 (Ousterhout/APOSD): Measures module depth (interface surface vs implementation richness), scores agent instruction quality (WHAT vs HOW), and detects entanglement between agents via SCD field sharing.
- `src/core/synapses/bundle_coherence.py` — Synapse 2 (Wei 2026): Validates that Conductor-generated WorkflowPlans maintain architectural bundle coherence. Enforces empirically-validated co-occurrence rules (multi-agent requires durable context, broad tools require policy approval, recursive requires depth limits).
- `src/core/synapses/epistemic_stance.py` — Synapse 5 (King & Kimble 2004): Decomposes catalog_confidence into four epistemic sub-signals (structural, behavioral, domain, change). Classifies artifact type (code vs knowledge), identifies assumptions to document, and recommends execution approach.
- `src/core/synapses/synapse_engine.py` — Integrated engine orchestrating all five synapses in correct firing order. Produces SynapseAssessment with risk signals, design quality score, conductor guidance, and recommended topology.
- `docs/adr/ADR-024-swe-synapses-cognitive-architecture.md` — Architecture decision record documenting the five synapses, academic grounding, Risk Engine extension, Fidelity Score enhancement, and Conductor integration.

Rebalanced existing dimensions (spec_adherence 25%, reasoning_quality 15%, context_utilization 10%, governance_compliance 15%, user_value_delivery 10%). Backward compatible: returns 0.5 when no synapse assessment is provided.

### Changed — Conductor Integration with SynapseEngine (ADR-024)
- `src/core/orchestration/conductor_integration.py` — `generate_conductor_manifest()` now runs the SynapseEngine pre-plan (determines paradigm, recommended agents, conductor guidance) and post-plan (validates depth and coherence). Synapse assessment metadata stored in manifest for downstream observability. Added `data_contract`, `catalog_metadata`, `prior_success_rate`, and `failure_recurrence` parameters for synapse input.

### Added — Persona-Based Portal UX + DORA Sun Card (PEC Blueprint Ch. 11-12)

- `src/core/risk/risk_config.py` — Knowledge artifact defining thresholds (τ_warn=0.08, τ_escalate=0.15, τ_block=0.40), signal weights, and Recursive Optimizer parameters (learning rate, weight decay, clamping).
- `src/core/risk/risk_signals.py` — Contextual Encoder extracting 13 risk signals from data contract, DORA metrics, failure history, and onboarding catalog. Signals span historical (CFR, recurrence, hotspots), complexity (files, cyclomatic, dependencies, cross-module), DORA trends (lead time, deploy frequency), organism level, and protective factors (test coverage, prior success, catalog confidence).
- `src/core/risk/inference_engine.py` — Core engine: weighted sum → sigmoid → classification → XAI explanation. Includes Recursive Optimizer (gradient descent on prediction errors) for self-improving weights after task outcomes.
- `tests/test_risk_inference_engine.py` — 33 tests covering signal extraction, inference scoring, threshold classification, explanation generation, recursive optimizer, serialization, and 3 end-to-end PEC Blueprint scenarios.

Generates dynamic WorkflowPlans with focused subtask instructions, communication topologies (access lists), task-difficulty adaptivity via organism ladder, and bounded recursive self-referential scaling (max depth 2).
- `src/core/orchestration/conductor_integration.py` — Integration layer bridging Conductor with DistributedOrchestrator. Feature flag `CONDUCTOR_ENABLED` (default true for O3+ tasks). Handles recursive refinement loop, manifest conversion, and subtask env injection.
- `docs/design/conductor-orchestration-pattern.md` — Design document mapping the paper's concepts to FDE implementation: topology types (sequential, parallel, tree, debate, recursive), agent capability matching, confidence-based recursion, and integration with DistributedOrchestrator.
- `docs/adr/ADR-020-conductor-orchestration-pattern.md` — Architecture decision record documenting the choice of LLM-generated plans over static topology libraries or full RL training.
- `src/core/orchestration/__init__.py` — Updated exports to include Conductor, WorkflowPlan, WorkflowStep, TopologyType, should_use_conductor, generate_conductor_manifest, execute_with_conductor.

### Added — Orchestrator Container for Distributed Execution
- `infra/docker/Dockerfile.orchestrator` — New container image for the distributed orchestrator. Clones workspace via EFS, dispatches agent tasks via ECS RunTask, monitors completion, and triggers delivery.
- `infra/terraform/distributed-infra.tf` — ECS task definition for orchestrator container with EFS mount, IAM permissions for RunTask dispatch.

### Added — Two-Way Door Execution Mode Switch (ADR-021)
- `infra/terraform/eventbridge.tf` — `execution_mode` variable (`monolith` | `distributed`) switches EventBridge target between strands-agent and orchestrator task definitions. Rollback in <30s via `terraform apply`.
- `docs/adr/ADR-021-two-way-door-distributed-execution.md` — Architecture decision record documenting the two-way door mechanism, alternatives rejected, and consequences.

### Added — Explainability Layer for Pipeline Reasoning
- `infra/docker/agents/explainability.py` — Reasoning rail that captures and structures agent decision points (why this approach, what alternatives considered, confidence level). Emits structured events to DynamoDB for portal visibility.

### Added — ConductorPlanCard Portal Component
- `infra/portal-src/src/components/ConductorPlanCard.tsx` — Visualizes Conductor-generated WorkflowPlans: topology graph, agent assignments, subtask instructions, and execution progress.

### Changed — Agent Runner Conductor Integration
- `src/core/orchestration/agent_runner.py` — `_build_system_prompt()` now reads `AGENT_SUBTASK` env var for Conductor-generated focused instructions (falls back to generic role prompt when absent). `_load_scd_context()` now respects `AGENT_ACCESS_LIST` env var for communication topology enforcement (falls back to loading all previous stages when absent). Both changes are backward-compatible.

### Changed — Stream Callback Tool Noise Filter
- `infra/docker/agents/stream_callback.py` — Added signal/noise classification for tool calls. Low-signal tools aggregated into summaries; high-signal tools emit full events. Reduces DynamoDB write volume and improves portal readability.

### Changed — Factory Data Mapper (Timeline + DORA Empty State)
- `infra/portal-src/src/mappers/factoryDataMapper.ts` — Client-side noise filter for timeline events. DORA metrics empty state handling (shows placeholder when no completed tasks exist). Aggregates consecutive same-type tool calls.

### Changed — Portal Delivery Badge
- `infra/portal-src/src/App.tsx` — Replaced cryptic "NO PR" amber badge with clear delivery status indicators: "Delivered", "Pending Push", "Push Failed (retry)". Tooltip shows failure reason when applicable.

### Changed — EventBridge Execution Mode Routing
- `infra/terraform/eventbridge.tf` — Conditional target selection based on `execution_mode` variable. Both task definition ARNs referenced; only the active one receives events.

### Fixed — PII Removal from Tracked Files
- Removed all hardcoded account IDs, profile names, and email addresses from tracked files. Replaced with environment variable references and placeholders.

### Fixed — AWS_PROFILE Default for SSO Auth
- `infra/terraform/providers.tf` — Removed hardcoded profile name. Uses `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable (defaults to `profile-rocand` for SSO authentication when not set).

### Fixed — Push Stale Ref on Re-Worked Tasks (COE-021)
- `infra/docker/agents/workspace_setup.py` — Added `_fetch_remote_branch()` before push, `_find_existing_pr()` + `_update_pr()` for re-worked tasks. Hybrid safe push strategy handles all retry scenarios.

### Fixed — Portal Timeline Noise (COE-022)
- `infra/docker/agents/stream_callback.py` — Tool-call noise filter with signal/noise classification.
- `infra/portal-src/src/mappers/factoryDataMapper.ts` — Client-side noise filter + aggregation.
- `infra/portal-src/src/App.tsx` — Renamed "Chain of Thought" → "Pipeline Activity".

### Fixed — Cryptic 'NO PR' Badge
- `infra/portal-src/src/App.tsx` — Replaced raw "NO PR" badge with meaningful delivery status that distinguishes between "not yet pushed", "push failed", and "delivered".

### Added — Shell Command Context Parsing
- `infra/docker/agents/stream_callback.py` — `_handle_tool_input()` captures `contentBlockDelta` tool input and classifies shell commands into human-readable actions (git commit → "Committing changes...", pytest → "Running tests...", cat file.py → "Reading: file.py").

### Changed — Agent Role Labels in Timeline
- `infra/docker/agents/stream_callback.py` — Added `agent_role` field to DashboardCallback. Events now carry `phase=agent_role` so the portal shows the correct agent name instead of generic "fde-pipeline".
- `infra/docker/agents/orchestrator.py` — Passes `agent_role` when creating DashboardCallback instances.

### Changed — Portal Polling Interval
- `infra/portal-src/src/App.tsx` — Reduced polling from 15s to 5s to match stream_callback flush interval. Portal updates within ~5-10s without manual refresh.

### Fixed — DORA Lead Time Accuracy (COE-023)
- `infra/docker/agents/task_queue.py` — `update_task_stage()` sets `started_at = if_not_exists(started_at, :now)` idempotently. `complete_task()` calculates `duration_ms = now - started_at`.
- `infra/terraform/lambda/dashboard_status/index.py` — `_compute_elapsed()` uses `started_at` instead of `created_at`.

### Fixed — Push Force Fallback for Re-Worked Tasks
- `infra/docker/agents/workspace_setup.py` — Fallback from `--force-with-lease` to `--force` when the remote branch has divergent history from a previous pipeline run.

### Security
- Removed all hardcoded AWS account IDs, profile names, and email addresses from source-controlled files.
- Added `docs/example/` and `cloud-inventory.md` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental PII commits.
- `AWS_PROFILE` sourced from environment variable instead of hardcoded in Terraform provider configuration.

- `infra/terraform/dashboard-cdn.tf` — CloudFront: added `ordered_cache_behavior` for `/assets/*` (1-year immutable cache), reduced default TTL to 60s, added SPA fallback (403/404 → index.html).
- `scripts/deploy-dashboard.sh` — Added `--build` flag for source rebuild before deploy. Separated S3 uploads: index.html (no-cache), assets (immutable), images (24h cache).
- Docker images rebuilt for `linux/amd64` and pushed to ECR. ADOT sidecar rebuilt from official AWS public ECR image.
- EventBridge targets (GitHub, GitLab, Asana) updated from task definition revision `:11` → `:12`.

### Added — Portal Observability Data Mapper
- `infra/portal-src/src/mappers/factoryDataMapper.ts` — New mapper module with 5 functions: `mapDoraMetrics()`, `mapCostMetrics()`, `mapGateHistory()`, `mapLiveTimeline()`, `mapSquadExecution()`. Transforms raw `/status/tasks` API response into component prop shapes.
- `infra/portal-src/src/App.tsx` — Observability view now passes real API data to DoraCard, CostCard, GateHistoryCard, LiveTimeline, SquadExecutionCard via mapper functions.
- `infra/portal-src/src/services/factoryService.ts` — Added `agents` field to `DashboardData` interface (matches Lambda response).
- `infra/dashboard/` — Rebuilt with fresh Vite output containing mapper code.

### Fixed — COE-019: Observability Pipeline (StatusSync + Portal + OTEL)
- `infra/docker/agents/orchestrator.py` — Integrated `StatusSync` (was dead code) to post structured comments to GitHub issues on pipeline complete/fail. Added rebase-retry when push fails with stale ref. Emits `append_task_event(type="error")` on PR delivery failure. Emits gate events (constraint extraction, DoR, adversarial) and stage start/complete events to DynamoDB for portal visibility.
- `infra/docker/agents/stream_callback.py` — Expanded `DashboardCallback` reasoning markers (5→13 keywords), text markers (emojis, file ops, bold items, `#` headers), matching CloudWatch log visibility in the portal.

- `infra/portal-src/src/App.tsx` — Amber badge "NO PR" for `completed_no_delivery` status. Push failure indicator with tooltip.
- `infra/portal-src/src/services/factoryService.ts` — Added `pr_error` field to `Task` interface.
- `docs/corrections-of-error.md` — COE-019 documented with 3 root causes, 5 fixes, Well-Architected alignment.

### Added — OTEL Distributed Tracing (ADOT Sidecar)
- `infra/docker/agent_entrypoint.py` — `_init_telemetry()` initializes Strands SDK OTEL (agent/cycle/tool spans). No-op when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is unset.
- `infra/docker/requirements.txt` — Added `opentelemetry-api`, `opentelemetry-sdk`, `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http`, `opentelemetry-instrumentation-botocore`.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-07

### Added — Branch Evaluation Agent (ADR-018)
- `infra/docker/agents/branch_evaluation/` — 7-module evaluation engine: artifact classifier (9 types, prefix/suffix matching), scoring engine (7 dimensions, weighted aggregate, veto rules, auto-merge eligibility), code evaluator (D1 structural, D2 convention, D3 backward compat, D5 test coverage, D7 documentation), domain evaluator (D4 alignment, D6 adversarial resilience), report renderer (markdown PR comment + JSON artifact), merge handler (auto-merge + issue-to-DONE via GitHub REST + GraphQL).
- `infra/docker/agents/branch_evaluation/branch_evaluator.py` — Core orchestrator: git diff → classify → evaluate all 7 dimensions → produce verdict → render reports. Entry point for CLI and ECS execution.
- `infra/docker/agents/branch_evaluation/pipeline_graph.py` — Regression surface mapping: `find_tests_for_module()`, `find_consumers()`, `find_affected_edges()`, `find_contract_tests()`, `compute_regression_surface()`. Maps changed files to pipeline edges E1-E6.
- `scripts/evaluate_branch.py` — CLI entrypoint: `python3 scripts/evaluate_branch.py --base main --head feature/GH-42`. Exits 0 (merge eligible) or 1 (blocked). Supports --verbose, --quiet, --level, --output, --pr-comment.
- `.github/workflows/evaluate-branch.yml` — GitHub Action on `pull_request` (opened/synchronize/reopened). Steps: checkout → setup python → run evaluation → post PR comment (idempotent update) → set check status → auto-merge for score >= 8.0 + L1/L2.
- `.kiro/hooks/fde-branch-eval.kiro.hook` — `userTriggered` hook for local branch evaluation via Kiro agent.
- `infra/portal-src/src/components/BranchEvaluationCard.tsx` — Portal component: 7-dimension score bars, verdict badge, merge eligibility, veto warnings. Integrated into Gates view (`#gates`). i18n: en-US, pt-BR, es.
- `docs/adr/ADR-018-branch-evaluation-agent.md` — Architecture decision: deterministic scoring, no LLM in scoring path, auto-merge for L1/L2 with score >= 8.0.

### Added — Agent Brain → Portal CoT Bridge
- `infra/docker/agents/stream_callback.py` — Rewrote `DashboardCallback` to implement Strands SDK `__call__(**kwargs)` interface. Captures tool invocations (from `contentBlockStart` events), reasoning markers (decision/conclusion/approach keywords), and structural text (## headers, ✅/❌ markers). Batches writes (max 1/5s, max 10/buffer) to avoid DynamoDB write amplification.
- `infra/docker/agents/registry.py` — `create_agent()` now accepts optional `callback_handler` kwarg, passes to Strands `Agent()` constructor.
- `infra/docker/agents/orchestrator.py` — Creates `DashboardCallback(task_id)` before each agent execution, wiring the brain→portal bridge.
- Data flow: Agent brain (Bedrock stream) → DashboardCallback → DynamoDB events → Lambda `/status/tasks/{id}/reasoning` → Portal Reasoning view (15s polling).

### Added — Agent Identity Labeling + PR Attribution
- `infra/docker/agents/workspace_setup.py` — Git author now uses `FDE_AGENT_NAME`/`FDE_AGENT_EMAIL` env vars with issue number tag (e.g., `FDE Agent [GH-42]`) for commit traceability.
- `infra/docker/agents/orchestrator.py` — PR body includes Attribution section: agent as hands-on author, codebase owner as reviewer via CODEOWNERS, task ID for correlation.
- Configurable via env vars: `FDE_AGENT_NAME`, `FDE_AGENT_EMAIL` (defaults preserved for backward compatibility).

### Added — ADR-017: React Portal for Factory Observability UX
- `docs/adr/ADR-017-react-portal-observability-ux.md` — Documents the decision to adopt React + Vite + Tailwind for the portal layer. Partially supersedes ADR-011 (YAGNI) for the observability layer only. Covers: technology choices, data classification for exposed events, i18n governance (Ops team maintains, en-US/pt-BR/es), WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, supply chain risk mitigation.

### Added — Concurrency Guard Hardening (COE-016)
- `infra/docker/agents/task_queue.py` — `reap_stuck_tasks(max_age_minutes=60)`: marks orphaned IN_PROGRESS tasks as FAILED after 60min without update. `retry_queued_tasks(repo)`: finds tasks blocked by concurrency guard that are now eligible. `check_concurrency()`: fail-safe for `max_concurrent_tasks <= 0`. `complete_task()`: calls reap + retry on completion to close liveness gap.
- `infra/docker/agents/project_registry.py` — `FACTORY_ALLOW_AUTO_REGISTER` env var (default: true) gates auto-registration. `FACTORY_ALLOWED_ORGS` (comma-separated) restricts to specific GitHub/GitLab organizations. Unknown repos from non-allowed orgs get `max_concurrent_tasks=1`.
- `infra/docker/agents/orchestrator.py` — Calls `reap_stuck_tasks()` before every concurrency check, emits event if tasks were reaped.

### Fixed — Documentation Governance Debt (COE-012 through COE-017)
- `README.md` — Fixed stale counts: hooks 16→17, ADRs 13→17, flows 13→14, tests 54→171. Removed disconnected `> Generate: python3 scripts/generate_reference_architecture.py` from hero section. Added `fde-repo-onboard` to hook table. Expanded Code to Docs cross-reference. Expanded Repo Structure tests section (2→14 files).
- `docs/corrections-of-error.md` — Added COE-012 (doc drift recurrence), COE-013 (EventBridge multi-commit fix), COE-014 (Bedrock migration), COE-015 (bundled fixes), COE-016 (multi-project orchestration governance), COE-017 (React portal governance).
- `docs/architecture/design-document.md` — Bumped to v3.1 (2026-05-07). Testing Design expanded (3→16 entries). Hook count 16→17. Open Question #2 resolved (Strands SDK deployed). Added ADR-017 to Key Design Decisions.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-05

### Added — E2E Pipeline Data Travel Validation
- `tests/test_pipeline_data_travel.py` — 7 cross-module contract tests validating data flows across: Scope Check → Autonomy → Gate Resolution → Execution Plan → SDLC Gates (with enrichment). Proves module interfaces are compatible.
- `tests/test_orchestrator_e2e.py` — 3 E2E tests calling `orchestrator.handle_event()` with real EventBridge events. Proves the Orchestrator ACTUALLY wires scope check, autonomy, gate resolution, and execution plan tracking in production code.
- Resolves the "Node-scoped verification" anti-pattern (COE-052): modules are now validated as a composed system, not just in isolation.

### Changed — Orchestrator Wiring (v2 → v3)
- `infra/docker/agents/orchestrator.py` — `handle_event()` now wires the full pipeline:
  1. Scope Check (`check_scope()`) rejects out-of-scope tasks before any work starts
  2. Autonomy Level (`compute_autonomy_level()`) determines supervision level
  3. Gate Resolution (`resolve_pipeline_gates(level, confidence)`) determines which gates to run
  4. Execution Plan (`create_plan()` / `load_plan()` / `resume_from_plan()`) enables resumable execution
  5. Milestone tracking persists progress to disk after each gate completion
- New imports: `autonomy`, `execution_plan`, `scope_boundaries`
- New constructor parameter: `plans_dir` (filesystem path for execution plan persistence)
- New method: `_execute_pipeline_with_plan()` tracks inner loop gates as milestones
- Backward compatible: `handle_spec()` path unchanged

### Added — Agent-to-Agent PR Review (Task 5)
- `review_pr_with_llm()` in `pipeline_safety.py` — LLM-powered PR review that evaluates diffs against spec and constraints. Returns structured `PRReviewResult` with approved/concerns/suggestions
- `PRReviewResult` dataclass with `to_dict()` serialization
- Opt-in via `PR_REVIEW_LLM_ENABLED=true` env var (same pattern as constraint extraction)
- `_build_review_prompt()` — structured prompt with diff truncation (8000 char limit)
- `_parse_review_response()` — handles clean JSON, markdown code blocks, and invalid responses gracefully
- `_invoke_bedrock()` — same Bedrock invocation pattern as Constraint Extractor
- `tests/test_pr_llm_review.py` — 12 BDD scenarios covering opt-in behavior, response parsing, prompt construction, and dataclass serialization

### Added — Observability Accessible to Agent (Task 6)
- `read_factory_metrics` @tool in `tools.py` — returns DORA metrics for a specific task_id as JSON (read-only)
- `read_factory_health` @tool in `tools.py` — returns Factory Health Report as JSON (read-only, configurable window_days)
- Both tools added to `REPORTING_TOOLS` list (Reporting Agent only, not Engineering Agent)
- `tests/test_observability_tools.py` — 7 BDD scenarios validating tool registration, read-only separation, signatures, and callability

### Added — Execution Plans with Progress Tracking (Task 1)
- `infra/docker/agents/execution_plan.py` — Resumable pipeline execution with `ExecutionPlan` dataclass, milestone tracking (pending → in_progress → completed/skipped), append-only progress and decision logs, filesystem persistence (save/load/plan_exists), and `resume_from_plan()` that finds the first non-completed milestone
- `tests/test_execution_plans.py` — 15 BDD scenarios covering: plan creation, milestone progression, interruption/resume cycle (the core value prop), persistence roundtrip, corrupted file handling, and decision logging
- Source: OpenAI PLANS.md Cookbook — enables L3/L4 tasks to resume from interruption point

### Added — Doc-Gardening Agent (Task 2)
- `infra/docker/agents/doc_gardening.py` — Documentation drift detection with function registry pattern. 5 built-in checks: hook count badge, ADR count, flow count, design-document components, CHANGELOG freshness
- `.kiro/hooks/fde-doc-gardening.kiro.hook` — userTriggered hook to scan for documentation drift
- `tests/test_doc_gardening.py` — 12 BDD scenarios validating drift detection for all check types, registry extensibility, and crash resilience
- Resolves COE pattern: 6 of 9 entries were "doc was outdated"

### Added — Golden Principles + Garbage Collection (Task 4)
- `docs/design/golden-principles.md` — 5 mechanical code quality invariants (GP-01 through GP-05) with rule, rationale, detection logic, and remediation for each
- `infra/docker/agents/golden_principles.py` — Principle validation engine with `@register_principle` decorator pattern. Checks: max file size (500 lines), no print() in production, module docstrings, no import *, max function length (50 lines)
- `.kiro/hooks/fde-golden-principles.kiro.hook` — userTriggered hook to validate code against structural invariants
- `tests/test_golden_principles.py` — 13 BDD scenarios validating all 5 principles (positive + negative cases) plus integration and registry tests

### Added — Custom Linters with Remediation Messages (Task 3)
- `REMEDIATION_MAP` in `sdlc_gates.py` — 20 error code → remediation instruction mappings covering Python (ruff/flake8), TypeScript/JavaScript (eslint), Go (staticcheck), and Terraform (fmt)
- `_enrich_lint_output()` in `sdlc_gates.py` — post-processes raw lint output, appending actionable fix instructions after each recognized error line
- `check_lint()` now returns enriched errors so the agent sees remediation hints in the inner loop retry
- `tests/test_lint_remediation.py` — 12 BDD scenarios validating enrichment for Python, TypeScript, Go, multi-error, unknown codes, and edge cases

### Added — Minimal Gates for L5 High-Confidence Tasks (Task 7)
- `resolve_pipeline_gates()` in `autonomy.py` now accepts optional `confidence_level` parameter
- L5 tasks with `confidence_level == "high"` skip `dor_gate` and `ship_readiness` (inner loop gates provide sufficient validation)
- L5 tasks with any other confidence level retain standard L5 behavior (backward compatible)
- L4 and below are unaffected regardless of confidence level
- 5 new BDD scenarios in `tests/test_autonomy_level.py` (class `TestMinimalGatesL5`)

### Changed — Sprint 1 Throughput Improvements
- Source: OpenAI Harness Engineering ("custom lints with remediation instructions") + Ralph Loop ("corrections are cheap, waiting is expensive")
- Impact: Inner loop first-pass rate improvement (Task 3) + reduced latency for high-confidence L5 tasks (Task 7)
