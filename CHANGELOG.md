## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-11

### Added — Conductor Orchestration Pattern (ADR-020)
- `src/core/orchestration/conductor.py` — New Conductor engine implementing the RL Conductor pattern (Nielsen et al., ICLR 2026, arXiv:2512.04388v5). Generates dynamic WorkflowPlans with focused subtask instructions, communication topologies (access lists), task-difficulty adaptivity via organism ladder, and bounded recursive self-referential scaling (max depth 2).
- `src/core/orchestration/conductor_integration.py` — Integration layer bridging Conductor with DistributedOrchestrator. Feature flag `CONDUCTOR_ENABLED` (default true for O3+ tasks). Handles recursive refinement loop, manifest conversion, and subtask env injection.
- `docs/design/conductor-orchestration-pattern.md` — Design document mapping the paper's concepts to FDE implementation: topology types (sequential, parallel, tree, debate, recursive), agent capability matching, confidence-based recursion, and integration with DistributedOrchestrator.
- `docs/adr/ADR-020-conductor-orchestration-pattern.md` — Architecture decision record documenting the choice of LLM-generated plans over static topology libraries or full RL training.
- `src/core/orchestration/__init__.py` — Updated exports to include Conductor, WorkflowPlan, WorkflowStep, TopologyType, should_use_conductor, generate_conductor_manifest, execute_with_conductor.

### Changed — Agent Runner Conductor Integration
- `src/core/orchestration/agent_runner.py` — `_build_system_prompt()` now reads `AGENT_SUBTASK` env var for Conductor-generated focused instructions (falls back to generic role prompt when absent). `_load_scd_context()` now respects `AGENT_ACCESS_LIST` env var for communication topology enforcement (falls back to loading all previous stages when absent). Both changes are backward-compatible.

## [Previous] — 2026-05-08

### Fixed — COE-020: ECS Platform Mismatch + Multi-Model Infra + EventBridge Drift
- `Makefile` — Added `docker-build`, `docker-build-adot`, `docker-build-onboarding`, `docker-push-all`, `docker-deploy` targets. All enforce `--platform linux/amd64` for Fargate compatibility. ECR URL resolved from Terraform outputs.
- `infra/terraform/variables.tf` — Added `bedrock_model_reasoning` (Claude Sonnet 4), `bedrock_model_standard` (Claude Sonnet 4.5), `bedrock_model_fast` (Claude Haiku 4.5) as first-class infrastructure parameters.
- `infra/terraform/main.tf` — Strands agent task definition now passes `BEDROCK_MODEL_REASONING`, `BEDROCK_MODEL_STANDARD`, `BEDROCK_MODEL_FAST` env vars to the container.
- `infra/terraform/distributed-infra.tf` — Passes model tier variables through to ECS module.
- `infra/terraform/modules/ecs/agent_task_def.tf` — Squad agent task definition includes all 3 model tier env vars.
- `infra/terraform/dashboard-cdn.tf` — CloudFront: added `ordered_cache_behavior` for `/assets/*` (1-year immutable cache), reduced default TTL to 60s, added SPA fallback (403/404 → index.html).
- `scripts/deploy-dashboard.sh` — Added `--build` flag for source rebuild before deploy. Separated S3 uploads: index.html (no-cache), assets (immutable), images (24h cache).
- Docker images rebuilt for `linux/amd64` and pushed to ECR. ADOT sidecar rebuilt from official AWS public ECR image.
- EventBridge targets (GitHub, GitLab, Asana) updated from task definition revision `:11` → `:12`.

### Added — Portal Observability Data Mapper
- `infra/portal-src/src/mappers/factoryDataMapper.ts` — New mapper module with 5 functions: `mapDoraMetrics()`, `mapCostMetrics()`, `mapGateHistory()`, `mapLiveTimeline()`, `mapSquadExecution()`. Transforms raw `/status/tasks` API response into component prop shapes.
- `infra/portal-src/src/App.tsx` — Observability view now passes real API data to DoraCard, CostCard, GateHistoryCard, LiveTimeline, SquadExecutionCard via mapper functions.
- `infra/portal-src/src/services/factoryService.ts` — Added `agents` field to `DashboardData` interface (matches Lambda response).
- `infra/dashboard/` — Rebuilt with fresh Vite output containing mapper code.

### Fixed — COE-019: Observability Pipeline (StatusSync + Portal + OTEL)
- `infra/docker/agents/orchestrator.py` — Integrated `StatusSync` (was dead code) to post structured comments to GitHub issues on pipeline complete/fail. Added rebase-retry when push fails with stale ref. Emits `append_task_event(type="error")` on PR delivery failure. Emits gate events (constraint extraction, DoR, adversarial) and stage start/complete events to DynamoDB for portal visibility.
- `infra/docker/agents/stream_callback.py` — Expanded `DashboardCallback` reasoning markers (5→13 keywords), text markers (emojis, file ops, bold items, `#` headers), matching CloudWatch log visibility in the portal.
- `infra/terraform/lambda/dashboard_status/index.py` — Derives `completed_no_delivery` status for tasks that completed without a PR. Exposes `pr_error` field in API response.
- `infra/portal-src/src/App.tsx` — Amber badge "NO PR" for `completed_no_delivery` status. Push failure indicator with tooltip.
- `infra/portal-src/src/services/factoryService.ts` — Added `pr_error` field to `Task` interface.
- `docs/corrections-of-error.md` — COE-019 documented with 3 root causes, 5 fixes, Well-Architected alignment.

### Added — OTEL Distributed Tracing (ADOT Sidecar)
- `infra/docker/agent_entrypoint.py` — `_init_telemetry()` initializes Strands SDK OTEL (agent/cycle/tool spans). No-op when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is unset.
- `infra/docker/requirements.txt` — Added `opentelemetry-api`, `opentelemetry-sdk`, `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http`, `opentelemetry-instrumentation-botocore`.
- `infra/terraform/main.tf` — ADOT collector sidecar container (non-essential) in ECS task definition. OTEL env vars (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN`). X-Ray write IAM policy for task role.
- Architecture: Strands agent → localhost:4318 → ADOT sidecar → AWS X-Ray. Automatic spans for agent invocations, reasoning cycles, and tool calls.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-07

### Added — Branch Evaluation Agent (ADR-018)
- `infra/docker/agents/branch_evaluation/` — 7-module evaluation engine: artifact classifier (9 types, prefix/suffix matching), scoring engine (7 dimensions, weighted aggregate, veto rules, auto-merge eligibility), code evaluator (D1 structural, D2 convention, D3 backward compat, D5 test coverage, D7 documentation), domain evaluator (D4 alignment, D6 adversarial resilience), report renderer (markdown PR comment + JSON artifact), merge handler (auto-merge + issue-to-DONE via GitHub REST + GraphQL).
- `infra/docker/agents/branch_evaluation/branch_evaluator.py` — Core orchestrator: git diff → classify → evaluate all 7 dimensions → produce verdict → render reports. Entry point for CLI and ECS execution.
- `infra/docker/agents/branch_evaluation/pipeline_graph.py` — Regression surface mapping: `find_tests_for_module()`, `find_consumers()`, `find_affected_edges()`, `find_contract_tests()`, `compute_regression_surface()`. Maps changed files to pipeline edges E1-E6.
- `scripts/evaluate_branch.py` — CLI entrypoint: `python3 scripts/evaluate_branch.py --base main --head feature/GH-42`. Exits 0 (merge eligible) or 1 (blocked). Supports --verbose, --quiet, --level, --output, --pr-comment.
- `.github/workflows/evaluate-branch.yml` — GitHub Action on `pull_request` (opened/synchronize/reopened). Steps: checkout → setup python → run evaluation → post PR comment (idempotent update) → set check status → auto-merge for score >= 8.0 + L1/L2.
- `.kiro/hooks/fde-branch-eval.kiro.hook` — `userTriggered` hook for local branch evaluation via Kiro agent.
- `infra/portal-src/src/components/BranchEvaluationCard.tsx` — Portal component: 7-dimension score bars, verdict badge, merge eligibility, veto warnings. Integrated into Gates view (`#gates`). i18n: en-US, pt-BR, es.
- `docs/adr/ADR-018-branch-evaluation-agent.md` — Architecture decision: deterministic scoring, no LLM in scoring path, auto-merge for L1/L2 with score >= 8.0.

### Added — Agent Brain → Portal CoT Bridge
- `infra/docker/agents/stream_callback.py` — Rewrote `DashboardCallback` to implement Strands SDK `__call__(**kwargs)` interface. Captures tool invocations (from `contentBlockStart` events), reasoning markers (decision/conclusion/approach keywords), and structural text (## headers, ✅/❌ markers). Batches writes (max 1/5s, max 10/buffer) to avoid DynamoDB write amplification.
- `infra/docker/agents/registry.py` — `create_agent()` now accepts optional `callback_handler` kwarg, passes to Strands `Agent()` constructor.
- `infra/docker/agents/orchestrator.py` — Creates `DashboardCallback(task_id)` before each agent execution, wiring the brain→portal bridge.
- Data flow: Agent brain (Bedrock stream) → DashboardCallback → DynamoDB events → Lambda `/status/tasks/{id}/reasoning` → Portal Reasoning view (15s polling).

### Added — Agent Identity Labeling + PR Attribution
- `infra/docker/agents/workspace_setup.py` — Git author now uses `FDE_AGENT_NAME`/`FDE_AGENT_EMAIL` env vars with issue number tag (e.g., `FDE Agent [GH-42]`) for commit traceability.
- `infra/docker/agents/orchestrator.py` — PR body includes Attribution section: agent as hands-on author, codebase owner as reviewer via CODEOWNERS, task ID for correlation.
- Configurable via env vars: `FDE_AGENT_NAME`, `FDE_AGENT_EMAIL` (defaults preserved for backward compatibility).

### Added — ADR-017: React Portal for Factory Observability UX
- `docs/adr/ADR-017-react-portal-observability-ux.md` — Documents the decision to adopt React + Vite + Tailwind for the portal layer. Partially supersedes ADR-011 (YAGNI) for the observability layer only. Covers: technology choices, data classification for exposed events, i18n governance (Ops team maintains, en-US/pt-BR/es), WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, supply chain risk mitigation.

### Added — Concurrency Guard Hardening (COE-016)
- `infra/docker/agents/task_queue.py` — `reap_stuck_tasks(max_age_minutes=60)`: marks orphaned IN_PROGRESS tasks as FAILED after 60min without update. `retry_queued_tasks(repo)`: finds tasks blocked by concurrency guard that are now eligible. `check_concurrency()`: fail-safe for `max_concurrent_tasks <= 0`. `complete_task()`: calls reap + retry on completion to close liveness gap.
- `infra/docker/agents/project_registry.py` — `FACTORY_ALLOW_AUTO_REGISTER` env var (default: true) gates auto-registration. `FACTORY_ALLOWED_ORGS` (comma-separated) restricts to specific GitHub/GitLab organizations. Unknown repos from non-allowed orgs get `max_concurrent_tasks=1`.
- `infra/docker/agents/orchestrator.py` — Calls `reap_stuck_tasks()` before every concurrency check, emits event if tasks were reaped.

### Fixed — Documentation Governance Debt (COE-012 through COE-017)
- `README.md` — Fixed stale counts: hooks 16→17, ADRs 13→17, flows 13→14, tests 54→171. Removed disconnected `> Generate: python3 scripts/generate_reference_architecture.py` from hero section. Added `fde-repo-onboard` to hook table. Expanded Code to Docs cross-reference. Expanded Repo Structure tests section (2→14 files).
- `docs/corrections-of-error.md` — Added COE-012 (doc drift recurrence), COE-013 (EventBridge multi-commit fix), COE-014 (Bedrock migration), COE-015 (bundled fixes), COE-016 (multi-project orchestration governance), COE-017 (React portal governance).
- `docs/architecture/design-document.md` — Bumped to v3.1 (2026-05-07). Testing Design expanded (3→16 entries). Hook count 16→17. Open Question #2 resolved (Strands SDK deployed). Added ADR-017 to Key Design Decisions.

### Fixed — EventBridge → ECS Pipeline (COE-011)
- `infra/terraform/eventbridge.tf` — InputTransformer changed from broken single-JSON-string pattern to flat scalar env vars (EVENT_SOURCE, EVENT_ACTION, EVENT_LABEL, EVENT_ISSUE_NUMBER, EVENT_ISSUE_TITLE, EVENT_REPO). Root cause: ECS RunTask silently rejects overrides with unescaped JSON objects in string values.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-05

### Added — E2E Pipeline Data Travel Validation
- `tests/test_pipeline_data_travel.py` — 7 cross-module contract tests validating data flows across: Scope Check → Autonomy → Gate Resolution → Execution Plan → SDLC Gates (with enrichment). Proves module interfaces are compatible.
- `tests/test_orchestrator_e2e.py` — 3 E2E tests calling `orchestrator.handle_event()` with real EventBridge events. Proves the Orchestrator ACTUALLY wires scope check, autonomy, gate resolution, and execution plan tracking in production code.
- Resolves the "Node-scoped verification" anti-pattern (COE-052): modules are now validated as a composed system, not just in isolation.

### Changed — Orchestrator Wiring (v2 → v3)
- `infra/docker/agents/orchestrator.py` — `handle_event()` now wires the full pipeline:
  1. Scope Check (`check_scope()`) rejects out-of-scope tasks before any work starts
  2. Autonomy Level (`compute_autonomy_level()`) determines supervision level
  3. Gate Resolution (`resolve_pipeline_gates(level, confidence)`) determines which gates to run
  4. Execution Plan (`create_plan()` / `load_plan()` / `resume_from_plan()`) enables resumable execution
  5. Milestone tracking persists progress to disk after each gate completion
- New imports: `autonomy`, `execution_plan`, `scope_boundaries`
- New constructor parameter: `plans_dir` (filesystem path for execution plan persistence)
- New method: `_execute_pipeline_with_plan()` tracks inner loop gates as milestones
- Backward compatible: `handle_spec()` path unchanged

### Added — Agent-to-Agent PR Review (Task 5)
- `review_pr_with_llm()` in `pipeline_safety.py` — LLM-powered PR review that evaluates diffs against spec and constraints. Returns structured `PRReviewResult` with approved/concerns/suggestions
- `PRReviewResult` dataclass with `to_dict()` serialization
- Opt-in via `PR_REVIEW_LLM_ENABLED=true` env var (same pattern as constraint extraction)
- `_build_review_prompt()` — structured prompt with diff truncation (8000 char limit)
- `_parse_review_response()` — handles clean JSON, markdown code blocks, and invalid responses gracefully
- `_invoke_bedrock()` — same Bedrock invocation pattern as Constraint Extractor
- `tests/test_pr_llm_review.py` — 12 BDD scenarios covering opt-in behavior, response parsing, prompt construction, and dataclass serialization

### Added — Observability Accessible to Agent (Task 6)
- `read_factory_metrics` @tool in `tools.py` — returns DORA metrics for a specific task_id as JSON (read-only)
- `read_factory_health` @tool in `tools.py` — returns Factory Health Report as JSON (read-only, configurable window_days)
- Both tools added to `REPORTING_TOOLS` list (Reporting Agent only, not Engineering Agent)
- `tests/test_observability_tools.py` — 7 BDD scenarios validating tool registration, read-only separation, signatures, and callability

### Added — Execution Plans with Progress Tracking (Task 1)
- `infra/docker/agents/execution_plan.py` — Resumable pipeline execution with `ExecutionPlan` dataclass, milestone tracking (pending → in_progress → completed/skipped), append-only progress and decision logs, filesystem persistence (save/load/plan_exists), and `resume_from_plan()` that finds the first non-completed milestone
- `tests/test_execution_plans.py` — 15 BDD scenarios covering: plan creation, milestone progression, interruption/resume cycle (the core value prop), persistence roundtrip, corrupted file handling, and decision logging
- Source: OpenAI PLANS.md Cookbook — enables L3/L4 tasks to resume from interruption point

### Added — Doc-Gardening Agent (Task 2)
- `infra/docker/agents/doc_gardening.py` — Documentation drift detection with function registry pattern. 5 built-in checks: hook count badge, ADR count, flow count, design-document components, CHANGELOG freshness
- `.kiro/hooks/fde-doc-gardening.kiro.hook` — userTriggered hook to scan for documentation drift
- `tests/test_doc_gardening.py` — 12 BDD scenarios validating drift detection for all check types, registry extensibility, and crash resilience
- Resolves COE pattern: 6 of 9 entries were "doc was outdated"

### Added — Golden Principles + Garbage Collection (Task 4)
- `docs/design/golden-principles.md` — 5 mechanical code quality invariants (GP-01 through GP-05) with rule, rationale, detection logic, and remediation for each
- `infra/docker/agents/golden_principles.py` — Principle validation engine with `@register_principle` decorator pattern. Checks: max file size (500 lines), no print() in production, module docstrings, no import *, max function length (50 lines)
- `.kiro/hooks/fde-golden-principles.kiro.hook` — userTriggered hook to validate code against structural invariants
- `tests/test_golden_principles.py` — 13 BDD scenarios validating all 5 principles (positive + negative cases) plus integration and registry tests

### Added — Custom Linters with Remediation Messages (Task 3)
- `REMEDIATION_MAP` in `sdlc_gates.py` — 20 error code → remediation instruction mappings covering Python (ruff/flake8), TypeScript/JavaScript (eslint), Go (staticcheck), and Terraform (fmt)
- `_enrich_lint_output()` in `sdlc_gates.py` — post-processes raw lint output, appending actionable fix instructions after each recognized error line
- `check_lint()` now returns enriched errors so the agent sees remediation hints in the inner loop retry
- `tests/test_lint_remediation.py` — 12 BDD scenarios validating enrichment for Python, TypeScript, Go, multi-error, unknown codes, and edge cases

### Added — Minimal Gates for L5 High-Confidence Tasks (Task 7)
- `resolve_pipeline_gates()` in `autonomy.py` now accepts optional `confidence_level` parameter
- L5 tasks with `confidence_level == "high"` skip `dor_gate` and `ship_readiness` (inner loop gates provide sufficient validation)
- L5 tasks with any other confidence level retain standard L5 behavior (backward compatible)
- L4 and below are unaffected regardless of confidence level
- 5 new BDD scenarios in `tests/test_autonomy_level.py` (class `TestMinimalGatesL5`)

### Changed — Sprint 1 Throughput Improvements
- Source: OpenAI Harness Engineering ("custom lints with remediation instructions") + Ralph Loop ("corrections are cheap, waiting is expensive")
- Impact: Inner loop first-pass rate improvement (Task 3) + reduced latency for high-confidence L5 tasks (Task 7)

- `infra/docker/agents/agent_builder.py` — Just-in-time agent provisioning from data contract. Queries Prompt Registry by tech_stack context tags, injects extracted constraints into agent prompts, selects tool set by task type.
- `infra/docker/agents/project_isolation.py` — SaaS-kernel project isolation. Each task gets isolated S3 prefix, workspace directory, git branch, and correlation ID. Zero cross-project interference.
- `infra/docker/agents/sdlc_gates.py` — Inner loop (lint → typecheck → unit-test → build) and outer loop (DoR → Constraint Extraction → Adversarial → Ship-Readiness) gate enforcement with retry logic and timing.
- `infra/docker/agents/pipeline_safety.py` — PR Diff Review Gate (secret scanning, debug code detection, size checks) + Automatic Rollback (checkpoint + git reset to known-good state on feature branches).
- `infra/docker/agents/dora_metrics.py` — DORA Metrics Collector with 4 core metrics (Lead Time, Deployment Frequency, Change Failure Rate, MTTR) + 5 factory metrics. Domain segmentation by tech_stack. Factory Health Report with DORA level classification (Elite/High/Medium/Low).

### Added — Over-Engineering Mitigations (ADR-012)
- LLM constraint extraction is opt-in (default off). Enable via env var, constructor flag, or per-task field.
- Fast path for bugfix/documentation tasks with empty constraints — skips extraction entirely.
- ADR-011: Multi-Cloud Adapter deferred until customer demand. `target_environment` preserved in data contract.
- ADR-012: Over-Engineering Mitigations and Gap Closures (6 decisions with adversarial analysis)

### Changed — Router (v1 → v2)
- `infra/docker/agents/router.py` — Now extracts the full canonical data contract from platform-specific event payloads (GitHub issue form sections, GitLab scoped labels, Asana custom fields). `RoutingDecision` carries `data_contract` dict.

### Changed — Orchestrator (v1 → v2)
