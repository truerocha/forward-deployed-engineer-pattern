## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-06

### Added — Dead-Letter Handler and Observability (ADR-014, OPS 6 + OPS 8)
- `infra/terraform/lambda/dead_letter/index.py` — Dead-letter Lambda handler for permanently failed DAG fan-out invocations. Extracts failed task metadata from SQS messages, publishes structured alerts to SNS, marks tasks as `DEAD_LETTER` in DynamoDB for visibility.
- `infra/terraform/observability.tf` — Full observability layer: SNS topic (`fde-dev-pipeline-alerts`), SQS dead-letter queue (`fde-dev-dag-fanout-dlq`), dead-letter Lambda with IAM role, SQS→Lambda event source mapping, 6 CloudWatch alarms (fan-out errors, dead-letter invocations, fan-out throttles, DynamoDB read/write throttles, fan-out duration approaching timeout).
- `docs/guides/deployment-setup.md` — AWS deployment prerequisites guide: SSO profile configuration, session authentication, Terraform variables, init/plan/apply commands, common errors and fixes, teardown, post-deploy steps.
- CloudWatch alarms route to SNS topic for operator notification (email subscription supported).

### Changed — DAG Fan-Out On-Failure Destination (ADR-014)
- `infra/terraform/dag_fanout.tf` — Added `destination_config.on_failure` pointing to SQS dead-letter queue. Added `sqs:SendMessage` permission to fan-out Lambda IAM policy. Failed batches (after DynamoDB Stream's 3 retries) now route to SQS → dead-letter Lambda → SNS alert.

### Changed — README Documentation Index
- `README.md` — Added [AWS Deployment Setup](docs/guides/deployment-setup.md) and [Auth Setup](docs/guides/auth-setup.md) to the Documentation Index table.

### Infrastructure Deployed
- Stack applied to AWS account 785640717688 (us-east-1): 74 resources total (4 added, 3 changed, 1 destroyed in final apply).
- SNS email subscription created for `rocand@amazon.com` (pending confirmation).

## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-05

### Added — E2E Pipeline Data Travel Validation
- `tests/test_pipeline_data_travel.py` — 7 cross-module contract tests validating data flows across: Scope Check → Autonomy → Gate Resolution → Execution Plan → SDLC Gates (with enrichment). Proves module interfaces are compatible.
- `tests/test_orchestrator_e2e.py` — 3 E2E tests calling `orchestrator.handle_event()` with real EventBridge events. Proves the Orchestrator ACTUALLY wires scope check, autonomy, gate resolution, and execution plan tracking in production code.
- Resolves the "Node-scoped verification" anti-pattern (COE-052): modules are now validated as a composed system, not just in isolation.

### Changed — Orchestrator Wiring (v2 → v3)
- `infra/docker/agents/orchestrator.py` — `handle_event()` now wires the full pipeline:
  1. Scope Check (`check_scope()`) rejects out-of-scope tasks before any work starts
  2. Autonomy Level (`compute_autonomy_level()`) determines supervision level
  3. Gate Resolution (`resolve_pipeline_gates(level, confidence)`) determines which gates to run
  4. Execution Plan (`create_plan()` / `load_plan()` / `resume_from_plan()`) enables resumable execution
  5. Milestone tracking persists progress to disk after each gate completion
- New imports: `autonomy`, `execution_plan`, `scope_boundaries`
- New constructor parameter: `plans_dir` (filesystem path for execution plan persistence)
- New method: `_execute_pipeline_with_plan()` tracks inner loop gates as milestones
- Backward compatible: `handle_spec()` path unchanged

### Added — Agent-to-Agent PR Review (Task 5)
- `review_pr_with_llm()` in `pipeline_safety.py` — LLM-powered PR review that evaluates diffs against spec and constraints. Returns structured `PRReviewResult` with approved/concerns/suggestions
- `PRReviewResult` dataclass with `to_dict()` serialization
- Opt-in via `PR_REVIEW_LLM_ENABLED=true` env var (same pattern as constraint extraction)
- `_build_review_prompt()` — structured prompt with diff truncation (8000 char limit)
- `_parse_review_response()` — handles clean JSON, markdown code blocks, and invalid responses gracefully
- `_invoke_bedrock()` — same Bedrock invocation pattern as Constraint Extractor
- `tests/test_pr_llm_review.py` — 12 BDD scenarios covering opt-in behavior, response parsing, prompt construction, and dataclass serialization

### Added — Observability Accessible to Agent (Task 6)
- `read_factory_metrics` @tool in `tools.py` — returns DORA metrics for a specific task_id as JSON (read-only)
- `read_factory_health` @tool in `tools.py` — returns Factory Health Report as JSON (read-only, configurable window_days)
- Both tools added to `REPORTING_TOOLS` list (Reporting Agent only, not Engineering Agent)
- `tests/test_observability_tools.py` — 7 BDD scenarios validating tool registration, read-only separation, signatures, and callability

### Added — Execution Plans with Progress Tracking (Task 1)
- `infra/docker/agents/execution_plan.py` — Resumable pipeline execution with `ExecutionPlan` dataclass, milestone tracking (pending → in_progress → completed/skipped), append-only progress and decision logs, filesystem persistence (save/load/plan_exists), and `resume_from_plan()` that finds the first non-completed milestone
- `tests/test_execution_plans.py` — 15 BDD scenarios covering: plan creation, milestone progression, interruption/resume cycle (the core value prop), persistence roundtrip, corrupted file handling, and decision logging
- Source: OpenAI PLANS.md Cookbook — enables L3/L4 tasks to resume from interruption point

### Added — Doc-Gardening Agent (Task 2)
- `infra/docker/agents/doc_gardening.py` — Documentation drift detection with function registry pattern. 5 built-in checks: hook count badge, ADR count, flow count, design-document components, CHANGELOG freshness
- `.kiro/hooks/fde-doc-gardening.kiro.hook` — userTriggered hook to scan for documentation drift
- `tests/test_doc_gardening.py` — 12 BDD scenarios validating drift detection for all check types, registry extensibility, and crash resilience
- Resolves COE pattern: 6 of 9 entries were "doc was outdated"

### Added — Golden Principles + Garbage Collection (Task 4)
- `docs/design/golden-principles.md` — 5 mechanical code quality invariants (GP-01 through GP-05) with rule, rationale, detection logic, and remediation for each
- `infra/docker/agents/golden_principles.py` — Principle validation engine with `@register_principle` decorator pattern. Checks: max file size (500 lines), no print() in production, module docstrings, no import *, max function length (50 lines)
- `.kiro/hooks/fde-golden-principles.kiro.hook` — userTriggered hook to validate code against structural invariants
- `tests/test_golden_principles.py` — 13 BDD scenarios validating all 5 principles (positive + negative cases) plus integration and registry tests

### Added — Custom Linters with Remediation Messages (Task 3)
- `REMEDIATION_MAP` in `sdlc_gates.py` — 20 error code → remediation instruction mappings covering Python (ruff/flake8), TypeScript/JavaScript (eslint), Go (staticcheck), and Terraform (fmt)
- `_enrich_lint_output()` in `sdlc_gates.py` — post-processes raw lint output, appending actionable fix instructions after each recognized error line
- `check_lint()` now returns enriched errors so the agent sees remediation hints in the inner loop retry
- `tests/test_lint_remediation.py` — 12 BDD scenarios validating enrichment for Python, TypeScript, Go, multi-error, unknown codes, and edge cases

### Added — Minimal Gates for L5 High-Confidence Tasks (Task 7)
- `resolve_pipeline_gates()` in `autonomy.py` now accepts optional `confidence_level` parameter
- L5 tasks with `confidence_level == "high"` skip `dor_gate` and `ship_readiness` (inner loop gates provide sufficient validation)
- L5 tasks with any other confidence level retain standard L5 behavior (backward compatible)
- L4 and below are unaffected regardless of confidence level
- 5 new BDD scenarios in `tests/test_autonomy_level.py` (class `TestMinimalGatesL5`)

### Changed — Sprint 1 Throughput Improvements
- Source: OpenAI Harness Engineering ("custom lints with remediation instructions") + Ralph Loop ("corrections are cheap, waiting is expensive")
- Impact: Inner loop first-pass rate improvement (Task 3) + reduced latency for high-confidence L5 tasks (Task 7)
